                         also known as gi-ri-yə) is an ancient rock fortress located north of the Matale Region near the town of 
                         Dambulla, in Central Province, Sri Lanka. It is a place of historical significance and archeology controlled
                          by a large stone column about 180 feet (590 ft) high. 

                        According to the ancient history of Sri Lanka Culavamsa, this area was a vast forest, and after the storms
                         and landslides it became a hill and was chosen by King Kashyapa (477 - 495 AD) with his new capital. He

                            Horton Plains is the source of three of Sri Lanka's three major rivers, the Mahaweli, Kelani, and Walawe. In Sinhala the plains are known as the Maha Eliya Plains (මහ එළිය තැන්න). Stone tools from the Balangoda tradition are found here. Wild vegetation is a grassy area covered by mountain forest and includes many endemic plants. The large herds of Sri Lankan Sambar deer thrive as common mammals and the park is also an important bird sanctuary with many species not only found in Sri Lanka but also restricted to the Horton Plains. Forest dieback is one of the major threats to the park and some studies suggest that it is caused by a natural event.
